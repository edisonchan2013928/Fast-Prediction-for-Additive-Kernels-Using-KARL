# Fast-Prediction-for-Additive-Kernels-Using-KARL
Before you use our codes, please make sure you understand our papers [a]. Our codes mainly support the fast prediction for additive kernel SVM, including Chi2 kernel, JS kernel, and Hellinger kernel. You need to follow the following three steps to use our codes.

1: Train your dataset ("Train" folder)
2: Convert the testing dataset and the model file (in SVM format) to our format ("file_conversion" folder)
3: Test your data ("Test" folder)

In the future, we plan to support:
1: fast training algorithms for additive kernel functions
2: fast prediction algorithms for other types of kernel functions
3: fast algorithms for other machine learning models (e.g., kernel clustering)
